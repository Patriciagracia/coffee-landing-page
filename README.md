# Coffee Shop Inspired Website

## Description
I created a one-page website inspired by the style of a coffee shop website I like. This project is built using React and has a modern and clean look. The design is fully responsive to ensure a great experience across all devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Vite** - Fast and optimized development environment
- **React** - Component-based UI library
- **HTML/CSS** - Structure and styling
- **Bootstrap** - Pre-built responsive design components
- **Typewriter-effect (npm)** - Animated typing effect

## Installation & Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Patriciagracia/coffee-landing-page
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

The site should now be running locally at `http://localhost:5173/` (or another port assigned by Vite).
